For ", ", this has been tricky. Innovation isn\u2019t quite his thing; the Colombian singer has been more interested in nailing formulas that produce massively successful hits\u2014and he\u2019s good at it.

His penchant for sliding in and out of characters has resulted in a few unexpected fusions, including collaborations with Brazilian artists Anitta and Nego de Bordel and traces of salsa on last summer\u2019s ", " But his surprise visual EP ", " is one of his most pronounced creative attempts and direct experiments with cross-cultural sounds yet.", "In January 2020, before the pandemic began, Maluma took a week-long vacation to Jamaica and returned home inspired by reggae and dancehall traditions. The focus on Jamaica carries a specific weight: Workers from the island\u2014who migrated to Panama alongside thousands of Caribbean laborers to build the Panama Canal among other infrastructure projects\u2014shaped reggae en espa\u00f1ol, which is the backbone of reggaeton. Songs such as Farruko and Bad Bunny\u2019s \u201c", "\u201d and J Balvin\u2019s \u201c", "\u201d have hinted at these diasporic connections, and Maluma is aware of at least some of the music\u2019s history. \u201cWe wouldn't have Urban Latino music without Africa and the contributions of the Black community in Latin American and here in the U.S.,\u201d he ", ". \u201cThis album is a small way to show my love for Jamaica and for Black culture.\u201d Such a statement is a rare and overdue acknowledgment of the Black and Caribbean erasure that occurs in the Spanish-speaking music industry.", "Still, this is reggae made in the image of Maluma, which is to say it\u2019s sleek and commercially minded. Flashes of authenticity appear in certain details, such as the Jamaican musicians and live instruments blended into the production, and the seven videos that premiered alongside the album celebrate locals and quotidian life on the island. However, these visuals also operate like a Maluma vacation lookbook, particularly in scenes where he chases after his co-star, former Miss Jamaica Davina Bennett. The music is benign and unobtrusive as the two splash on crystal beaches and grind on dancefloors in a never-ending spiral of prettiness. Even tracks that boast the co-signs of reggae legends\u2014the brassy \u201cTonika\u201d features Ziggy Marley and Charly Black lends vocals to the laidback melodies of \u201cLove\u201d\u2014are lacquered in a high-sheen gloss designed for feel-good radio play. Though Maluma seems to appreciate Jamaican sounds, the album isn\u2019t a deep interrogation or absorption of the styles he\u2019s using. There\u2019s a clear strategy involved in the decision to keep things light: It\u2019s what works best for the singer\u2019s brand and for his spumy delivery. \u201cAgua de Jamaica\u201d and \u201cDesayun Arte,\u201d in fact, are some of the record\u2019s best vocal performances precisely because of their breeziness.", "Maluma doesn\u2019t dive too far into Jamaican culture. Instead, he floats on the surface of the music and focuses on churning out a tidy, marketable compendium that, despite its limits, manages to broaden his range. And while he passes on the chance to do anything radical or cutting-edge, there is one flicker of inventiveness on \u201cLa Burbuja,\u201d a slinky sliver of dancehall that trades the project\u2019s mellow vibes for smoky clubbiness. The moment doesn\u2019t last long though, and #7DJ ends without becoming more than a quick, seven-day dip into the island.", " "]},

The lifelong devotee of ", " and ", " was now in search of something to do with the power he received on stage, something greasier than his idols, something less transcendent and more connected to the crusty highway life Steppenwolf touted in \u201c", ".\u201d", "Despite his efforts and the atomic thrust of Gorham and Robertson, Lynott never quite gets there on ", ", to the album\u2019s tremendous benefit. The band is simply too happy, too taken by how much they enjoy what they\u2019re doing\u2014both the music they were making and the way it allowed them to see themselves\u2014for the power and aggression of these songs to come across as truly dangerous or liberating. When the band added Gorham and Robertson and changed their direction, Thomson writes, \u201c[there] was a tenderness, a starry-eyed innocence and adventurism that did not wholly survive.\u201d This is true, but what did survive of that original sweetness makes ", " a hard rock album like no other. In effect, it turned the band into something like professional wrestlers working the circuit\u2014the muscles they flex are real, the fights themselves aren\u2019t, and they can still feel the humming in their bodies for days afterward.", "They knew how to use this to their artistic advantage. On its surface, the title track serves as a warning shot, the cry before the battle: \u201cTonight there\u2019s gonna be trouble,\u201d Lynott promises. It\u2019s tough-guy shit, but it\u2019s impossible to believe. All four of them are strutting, making a show of how easily they can control their power. This swagger\u2014the knowingness of it, how plainly they telegraph their pleasure\u2014is absurd; escaping prison has never sounded less risky. The original Thin Lizzy played with ", " and Slade, and Lynott\u2019s experience observing expert showmen up close, as well as the band\u2019s own connection with their audience, let them embrace the absurdity of living one\u2019s life as a rock star. It\u2019s a trait they shared with ", ", and it\u2019s what makes Lynott as irresistible on \u201cJailbreak\u201d as Billy Gibbons is on \u201c", ".\u201d He\u2019s clearly having a ball, savoring the posture of the chorus as he leans deep into the words \u201cDon\u2019t you be around,\u201d practically cooing for the listener in a way that is anything but threatening. He obviously wants you to be around.", "American critics ignorant of Lizzy\u2019s back catalog heard Lynott\u2019s alternately yawping and dewy vocals and assumed they were stolen from ", ", who had released ", " only months before ", ". In reality, they were simply drawing from the same source. Both singers nicked their style from Van Morrison, who approached both a song\u2019s meter and its melody as something he could drape his voice across and twirl around. You can hear it as Lynott rounds into the second verse of \u201cRomeo and the Lonely Girl,\u201d when he suddenly belts himself off track, his voice nearly breaking as he vamps near the high end of his range. It\u2019s as though what he\u2019s singing means so much to him that the restrictions of a rock song, even a loose Celtic boogie like this one, can\u2019t contain it; he simply has to break the rules to make you understand how he feels. When he\u2019s at his hammiest\u2014rhyming \u201cRomeo\u201d with \u201cout on his own-ee-oh,\u201d say\u2014you still feel close to him.", "Lynott pulls this trick over and over again on ", ", and it works every time, especially when he clearly doesn\u2019t believe what he\u2019s saying. Whether he\u2019s reassuring a former lover on the sax-laced power-pop of \u201cRunning Back\u201d or throttling the word \u201cLord\u201d as \u201cCowboy Song\u201d rises to a canter and he ruminates on \u201ca certain female,\u201d he flat-out refuses to sound lonely or contrite. He sings with relish, soaking in the intensity of the memories while keeping his eyes on whatever\u2019s next. It\u2019s consequence-free music, total fantasy, and he knows you\u2019re OK with that.", "Lynott enjoyed a reputation as a poetic lyricist, and his rakishness has an air about it that is popularly associated with poetry, or maybe just with poets: He implies a self-contained sensuality, a somewhat tragic devotion to love, a presumed dedication to deeper things. Put another way: He was a little pretentious. It\u2019s certainly a way of saying that his lyrics were usually decent at best, but that pretension makes him a compelling figure; it gives these songs a charge they would lack in hands that weren\u2019t so silky.", "Still, Lynott\u2019s suavity sometimes failed him. The son of an Irish mother and an Afro-Guyanese father, he strongly identified as an Irishman\u2014", "\u2019s \u201cEmerald\u201d is but one of the many odes to ancient Celtic lore that dot Thin Lizzy\u2019s discography\u2014but in 1976 he seemed unsure of what it meant to be a Black person in a very white rock\u2019n\u2019roll context. \u201cAmerican Black artists all seem to be rolling their eyes and wearing suits,\u201d he told ", "\u2019s Patrick Snyder before lamenting the apparent dearth of \u201crebellious ones.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like them to feel they can play rock and roll if they want to,\u201d he added.", "His attempts to write about his Blackness were similarly ambivalent. \u201cFight or Fall,\u201d which already has the unfortunate luck of being stuck between \u201cThe Boys Are Back in Town\u201d and the bucking \u201cCowboy Song,\u201d oscillates between a need to stand together with Black folks and Lynott\u2019s insistence that he\u2019s \u201cnot that way inclined.\u201d It\u2019s the quietest song on ", ", and while the closing shout of \u201cBrothers, we gotta fight for one another!\u201d could be read as pat, it comes across as an authentic attempt by the singer to navigate between his identities as a Black man and an Irishman. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of being a Brother. Don\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d he told ", " in 1977. \u201cBut I think that there are a lot of people like Stevie Wonder [who are] more apt than me to put it across.\u201d By staying true to that reticence, \u201cFight or Fall\u201d is probably the closest Lynott gets to exposing himself on this record.", "Disclosure, social responsibility, idealism: These are not ", "\u2019s values. But the album does speak clearly about who Phil Lynott and Thin Lizzy were, what they desired, and how they felt. Put aside the swashbuckling lyric and the serrated guitars, and \u201cThe Boys Are Back in Town\u201d is ", " at its most tender. Downey serves up a soft shuffle in the verses, while Robertson and Gorham fill the song with minor-key chords that turn the action back in on itself, their regret and vulnerability complicating the good cheer of Lynott\u2019s vocal. The lyrics obviously aren\u2019t sincere in their violence, but the boys\u2019 battle royale isn\u2019t quite camp, either; yes, he sings like he knows he\u2019ll be running off soon, but there\u2019s something sad in the sundown way Lynott emphasizes the word \u201cagain\u201d when he sings the chorus for the last time. It makes you wonder what life was like when the boys weren\u2019t around.", "Lynott was attempting to write an American song\u2014it started life as \u201cHere in Dallas,\u201d then became \u201cG.I. Joe Is Back\u201d\u2014and he was struck by the bar and grills he saw on tour the way an American in Ireland might be struck by the pubs. Though Thomson suggests it may have been influenced by the legitimate scumminess of the Rainbow Bar and Grill on the Sunset Strip, the reference to Dino\u2019s Bar and Grill nevertheless makes it sound like this song takes place in a Chili\u2019s. And that one quirk does make it feel American to its core, though not in the way that Lynott intended. Coupled with the guitarists\u2019 trick chords, it softens the song, makes it more palatable. It lets us all in on the joke: that rebellion isn\u2019t really rebellion when it\u2019s this agreeable. It\u2019s not a hard rock song; it\u2019s simply pretending to be one. And in that way, \u201cThe Boys Are Back in Town\u201d has become the kind of song that could be played ad nauseam in any suburban bar and grill in the U.S., just another small part of the American experience.", "This is the rock\u2019n\u2019roll life for most people who survive it: cashing checks for songs you wrote decades ago, struggling to balance adulthood with the demands of your livelihood. It becomes a job like any other job, defined by decisions you made before you were old enough to be trusted to make them well. Lynott lived long enough to see his star begin to fade as the punks who embraced him gave way to new wavers who didn\u2019t. Thin Lizzy\u2019s influence on metal and hard rock was already apparent, but his days at the center of the culture were over even before the band broke up. For a time, he was reduced to playing pubs and hotels back in Ireland, often to minuscule crowds.", " did prove that Lynott was right to think of himself as a superstar, at least for a little while. But the smoke and lightning and leather that got him there eventually overtook him. \u201cHe got wrapped up in the suit you\u2019re supposed to wear as a rock star,\u201d former bandmate Midge Ure said. In his finest moment, though, just before he was overtaken by the version of himself that had swelled in the spotlight, he and his boys managed to capture everything that\u2019s beautiful and good about rock\u2019n\u2019roll, and none of its ugly truth.", " "]},

He stood for a year on the picket line before the whole thing collapsed in 1964, sending his family of 16 scrambling for a new home. They packed up everything they had and hastily relocated to Buena Park, California, and then Sacramento. Iris\u2019 father found work as a gardener and a janitor, and her mother raised the family in extreme hardship. When things grew unbearably difficult, as they often did, Iris\u2019 mother Flora Mae sat down at the piano to sing.", "Iris\u2019 childhood was Pentecostal, which meant church, stark moral lines, and lots of gospel. Music was ever-present: It was a connection to the Arkansas Delta they\u2019d left behind and a vent for repressed feelings. Her older sisters formed a gospel group known as the DeMent Sisters and recorded one album. Her father played fiddle at dances and in church and her family passed the hymnal book around every week and harmonized. The first secular voices Iris heard were Johnny Cash and Loretta Lynn, but not until she was 5 years old. Before then, it was just her own voice, her mother\u2019s, and the hymnal book. \u201cShe told me, before she died, singing is praying,\u201d DeMent said of her mother, who died in 2011. \u201cI find that songwriting is praying, too.\u201d", "DeMent didn\u2019t begin writing her own songs or recording them until she was in her twenties. By then, she was living in Topeka, Kansas, cleaning houses and waitressing. Once in a while, to make extra money, she sang at nightclubs and bars. It stirred something in her, a nameless desire that she finally put a name to when she signed up for a creative writing course at Washburn College. She had always been intensely shy, even bashful, but, as she told Terry Gross in 2015, \u201cwhen the songs started coming to me, I felt I didn\u2019t have the option to hide.\u201d She wanted to be a singer and a songwriter, and she wanted her music in the world. She would write her own songs and record them, no matter if no one liked them, no matter if everyone laughed. So she borrowed her brother\u2019s guitar and sat down to write \u201cOur Town.\u201d", "Nearly 30 years later, the song\u2019s been passed around like a church plate\u2014you could hear it on Garrison Keillor\u2019s \u201cA Prairie Home Companion,\u201d on the series finale of ", ". DeMent writes from the perspective of a woman watching her small town dwindle and slip into the past. It\u2019s not a novel lens\u2014Americana and country music are full of the regrets of the small-towners who feel left behind, who understand that the bustle and business of living is something happening elsewhere, that they are the supporting characters of their own lives.", "But DeMent\u2019s version of this old trope stands out in part because of its unsentimental bleakness. The first line of the song\u2014\u201cAnd you know the sun\u2019s setting fast\u201d\u2014plunges us mid-sentence into a world where death is swiftly approaching. DeMent\u2019s verses are simple and spare, like all of her writing. She stops to note when she had her babies and where her parents are buried, takes a glance at the bar where she met her lover \u201con one hot summer night,\u201d and moves on. It could be any small town in America in the past 60 years, which is precisely the point. By the song\u2019s end, the narrator has set off for parts unknown (\u201cbut I don\u2019t wanna go\u201d) and the sense of desolation is overwhelming.", "The other reason, of course, that people were spooked to attention by \u201cOur Town\u201d was DeMent\u2019s voice. It is a tremulous wail, a disruptive vibration that shakes and rattles the spaces that attempt to contain it. When she sings, she often contorts her face into a comical grimace, like a small girl scolding her doll. People have described her voice as \u201cchildlike,\u201d but the wisdom in her delivery is far too grave, too matter-of-fact to ascribe to a child. It is the clarion voice of someone who has been singing to survive unimaginable hardship since they were little and who has never stopped to consider, even once, how they might sound to others.", "When DeMent\u2019s career began, listeners often assumed she had been raised in some Appalachian holler or on a dirt farm instead of an Orange County suburb. In this confusion, she was like many artists associated with American roots music: John Fogerty, for example, from Berkeley, or Buck Owens from Bakersfield; Dwight Yoakam from Los Angeles, or Gillian Welch from Manhattan. Like those artists, DeMent\u2019s connection was more spiritual than geographical. She might have moved hundreds of miles away, but she only had to open her mouth for everyone to hear the Pentecostal Arkansas Delta living inside her.", "Things moved fairly quickly for DeMent once she decided on singing. In 1988, she moved to Nashville; the folk label Rounder handed her a record contract shortly after. Her debut ", " was released in 1992 to universal acclaim, and less than a year later, someone played a demo for Lenny Waronker at Warner Brothers, who just as promptly bought her out of her Rounder contract. DeMent has been touring and releasing records at a steady clip ever since, save for a dry spell in the 2000s when she got married, battled depression, and emerged with 2012\u2019s stunning ", ".", "DeMent\u2019s story\u2014in its simple turns and clean lines\u2014shares a little with ", "\u2019s, an artist with whom she will forever be linked. Like Prine, DeMent wrote some of her most indelible and beloved songs on her very first try. DeMent\u2019s first two songs on ", " were \u201cOur Town\u201d and then \u201cLet the Mystery Be.\u201d If it is a clich\u00e9 to note when an artist arrives \u201cfully formed,\u201d it is nonetheless still a shock when a brand-new artist steps to a stage, clears their throat, and then seems to say with their first words precisely what they\u2019ve been waiting a lifetime to say.", "\u201cLet the Mystery Be\u201d is an astonishing, sui generis accomplishment\u2014a breezy song about not knowing where you go after you die. At first, DeMent sets out the terms of the great beyond in the simplest and folksiest imaginable language\u2014\u201cEverybody\u2019s wondering what and where they all came from\u201d\u2014before considering the various options before her. In her patience, she sounds like she\u2019s refereeing a particularly intractable family argument. She touches lightly on atheism (\u201cSome say once you\u2019re gone, you\u2019re gone forever\u201d) and on animism (\u201cSome say that they\u2019re coming back in a garden, bunch of carrots and little sweet peas\u201d) before returning, again and again, to the serenity of not knowing. \u201cI think I\u2019ll just let the mystery be,\u201d she sings, the sweet shrug audible in her voice.", "Among countless other things, the song also offers a plainspoken accounting for her own Pentecostal childhood, a way of sifting through what she will keep and what she\u2019s leaving behind. Over the years, she\u2019s repeatedly expressed gratitude for that culture, for the exposure to gospel and the deep spiritual well that nourished her, but she has spoken just as often of learning to leave behind its dogma. On \u201cLet the Mystery Be,\u201d she dispenses with damnation and purgatory and parses out the kernel she knows she will treasure (\u201cI believe in love and I live my life accordingly\u201d). It\u2019s like watching someone discover their guiding philosophy in real time every time you play it.", "She revisited this territory on 2012\u2019s \u201cThe Night I Learned How Not to Pray,\u201d which retold with harrowing simplicity the death of her friend\u2019s baby brother. \u201cI was sure if I prayed hard enough that God would make it right,\u201d she sings. When her efforts are unsuccessful (\u201cI knew that it was over when my sister slammed that phone against the wall\u201d) she learns a hard lesson, one she keeps from her family: \u201cGod does what he wants to anyway.\u201d", "Irreconcilable loss is DeMent\u2019s great theme, and it resounds across ", " On \u201cThese Hills,\u201d a nostalgic visit to the countryside of the narrator\u2019s youth quickly becomes a deathbed vision of paradise lying just beyond. Unlike Johnny Cash, she doesn\u2019t raise the fear of hellfire. On her cover of the Depression-era standard \u201cFifty Miles of Elbow Room,\u201d heaven is just some place where you\u2019ll finally get space to yourself. In her writing, death is nothing special, just another place humans go.", "But there is also nothing storybook about her writing. DeMent\u2019s best songs lean into the crippling heartache of loss with the same sobriety with which they examine the mysteries of the afterlife. \u201cAfter You\u2019re Gone\u201d feels like the flip side to the serenity of \u201cLet the Mystery Be\u201d\u2014the dead may not have much left to worry about, or to feel, wherever they\u2019re headed. But those of us left on earth must walk in the wilderness, and DeMent\u2019s writing leads us through it, cutting a new path with each line.", "\u201cThere\u2019ll be laughter even after you\u2019re gone/I\u2019ll find reasons to face that empty dawn\u201d\u2014in just one couplet, DeMent encompasses grief in all its platitudinous truths and ugly realities. Scan the YouTube comments for one of these songs and visit a wailing wall of lost relatives, brothers, sisters, spouses. It is clear these songs have soundtracked countless funerals, induced communal waves of compulsive sobbing. There is a moment, in the brittle numbness of fresh grief, when you yearn for something, anything to reach through to the raw mess of nerves and viscera underneath. You are awaiting\u2014dreading, craving\u2014the gut punch. And Iris DeMent songs gently provide it.", "The penultimate song on ", " revisits the wellspring of all of DeMent\u2019s music, the reason for the purity of her singing and the clarity of her vision. It is called \u201cMama\u2019s Opry,\u201d and it tells in loving detail of watching her mother sing country songs to herself under her breath. The indelible image, which lingers over the album, is of young Iris noticing the private sparkle in her mother\u2019s eyes as she hums Jimmie Rodgers, pinning clothes on the line: \u201cI\u2019d be playing in the grass/To her what might\u2019ve seemed obliviously/But there ain\u2019t no doubt about it, she sure made her mark on me.\u201d", "The snapshot is both intimate and clear, and in just two lines, it delivers us back to a vanished world. This deliverance has always been the promise of Americana\u2014premised on the idea that the world it depicted was gone, and had perhaps never existed outside of fleeting moments of the imagination. But the message living within it only grows more powerful as we make our way through successive seasons of loss. Your childhood home, your family, and your entire way of life may disappear. Whatever you can offer in this contingent world is whatever is left inside of you when all else is gone, and what comes out of you when you open your mouth.", " "]},

They sound spirited and alive, if a bit slick compared to the original, updating the sprawling Trees sound with additional instrumentation and occasional electronic textures that would have been difficult for a rock band to employ in their time. The COVID-19 pandemic stifled plans for a further reunion, according to the liner notes. Then, in mid-January, Celia Ford Drummond, n\u00e9e Humphris, died of undisclosed causes, having lived just long enough to witness this latest loving tribute to the band she fronted for a few years as a young woman.

In this girl\u2019s ", " she recognized kinship, community, and shared taste. At the time, Elizabeth Price, an art student who would later ", " Britain\u2019s splashy Turner Prize, had no idea how to sing or play an instrument. No matter. The music Fletcher and Price would create as part of a group they named Talulah Gosh did not prioritize formal skill. Combining C86 jangle with girl-group swooning, Talulah Gosh\u2019s songs were gloriously scrappy. As if to emphasize the band\u2019s informality, they never released a proper full-length; two years after forming, with a handful of singles to their name, Talulah Gosh dissolved. After briefly toying with the idea of ", " pop stardom, in 1989, Fletcher started a new band called Heavenly.", "During their seven years of existence, Heavenly released four studio albums, but a recent singles collection, ", ", makes the case that some of their most magical work existed in smaller formats. At first, Heavenly might have appeared to be a continuation of Talulah Gosh under a different name. After all, the two bands shared nearly identical lineups: Fletcher, her brother Mathew, Peter Momtchiloff, and Robert Pursey (a few years later they were joined by Cathy Rogers). But as suggested by the project\u2019s early singles, \u201cI Fell in Love Last Night\u201d and \u201cOur Love is Heavenly,\u201d Heavenly would (for the most part) iron the punk wrinkles out of their songs. Built around upbeat melodies, \u201960s pop harmonies, and a staunchly optimistic view of love (purely romantic, rarely sexual), these new songs were tighter than any of Talulah Gosh\u2019s offerings. It was only fitting that Heavenly would sign to Sarah Records, the beloved Bristol label known for releasing music made by introspective wallflowers.", "Like other Sarah bands, Heavenly\u2019s style\u2014both music and aesthetic\u2014was polarizing. In its earliest days, indie pop was a parallel movement to punk. Both scenes touted the belief that anyone could make music on their own terms, that mistakes were something to be celebrated. But punk was associated with fearlessness, or at least the facade of that confidence. So maybe if you identified with the punk spirit but weren\u2019t angling for anarchy, you became an indie pop kid. Instead of wearing a T-shirt held together with safety pins, you rocked anoraks and cardigans; you were probably a bit dweeby.", "Critics reviled indie poppers for their \u201cshambling\u201d songs about crushes and heartache, grade school ", ", and embrace of \u201cgirly\u201d qualities like sensitivity or softness. In Heavenly\u2019s case, the criticism easily and often veered towards sexism. In a particularly cruel ", " of the band\u2019s 1992 album, ", ", Melody Maker writer Simon Price accused Fletcher of spending \u201cher entire adult life pretending she doesn\u2019t menstruate,\u201d painted her bandmates as developmentally challenged, and used a variety of other lazy insults to describe the group as infantile. (A much more interesting criticism of indie pop could have been about the scene\u2019s overwhelming whiteness, a point that was unlikely to be explored by the majority-white music press.)", "So while it\u2019s true that Heavenly songs often framed the world through a childlike lense, their choice to do so was likely not rooted in a desire to escape or regress. \u201cI spent from age 13 to age 17 trying to act like I was 25 and trying to prove to boys I knew all about sex and I didn\u2019t and trying to prove I was cool and no one could hurt me when they could,\u201d Fletched explained in a 1995 ", " about cuddlecore. \u201cAt 18, I thought 'fuck it, I don\u2019t care anymore. I\u2019m just gonna be what I feel like being.\u2019\u201d", "In retrospect, it seems like Heavenly\u2019s critics were too preoccupied with twee to consider the darkness that lurked in the shadows of Heavenly\u2019s songs. In the early singles featured on ", ", these glimmers of pain tend to arrive as a result of heartbreak: \u201cI\u2019m Not Scared of You\u201d aches with betrayal, while \u201cWrap My Arms Around Him\u201d struggles to move past a manipulative relationship. On the other end of the spectrum, 1991\u2019s chipper \u201cEscort Crash on Marston Street\u201d imagines the entire band\u2019s death or injury in a horrific car crash. But as Fletcher cheerily notes, \u201cThe kids are happy/With no more boring Heavenly tunes.\u201d", "Beginning with ", ", Heavenly\u2019s records were distributed in the U.S. by ", ", the Olympia, Washington-based label run by Calvin Johnson, whose own band, ", ", faced similar criticisms about ", ". Through their connection with K and friendships with bands like ", " and Huggy Bear, Heavenly were exposed to the burgeoning riot grrrl movement, whose feminist, DIY spirit struck a chord with Fletcher. Quickly, Heavenly\u2019s songs began to incorporate more nuanced narratives about sexual politics and gender roles. On the fiery \u201cAtta Girl,\u201d Fletcher and Rogers offer overlapping perspectives on smothering, unrealistic relationships. \u201cNo, I could never live up to all your dreams/I don\u2019t have to be cute right through,\u201d an exasperated Fletcher shouts early on. Like ", "\u2019s \u201cRebel Girl,\u201d the bubbly \u201cP.U.N.K.

But like it so easily can in real life, the narrative turns on a dime and suddenly, Melanie\u2019s fantasy becomes a nightmarish depiction of date rape. \u201cIt was all so different from in her dream,\u201d Fletcher murmurs as her pep collapses into a traumatized monotone. \u201cHe never smiled, he never whispered/He bit her hard, but never kissed her.\u201d Heavenly follows this anecdote with a chaotically joyful ", " a casual listener could be forgiven for missing the horror. Arguably, \u201cHearts and Crosses\u201d is the band\u2019s best song.

Around 1983, the surging momentum of the post-punk era dissipated into a confused clutter of trends and revivals. People who\u2019d begun their musical journey in roughly the same spot\u2014the Sex Pistols, the Clash\u2014were now making sounds unrelated to each other and a long distance from their starting point.", "Even though it came out on the archetypal post-punk independent label Rough Trade, few records could have been further from the filth and fury of 1977 than the pastoral ambient music of Virginia Astley\u2019s 1983 album ", ". She had been a punk fellow traveler as a teenager in the late \u201970s, going to rowdy gigs and playing in pubs herself as keyboardist in the new wave group Victims of Pleasure. By training and temperament, though, Astley did not fit the standard profile of a post-punk musician. That movement teemed with art-school students who approached music-making conceptually. Astley attended music college and arrived on the scene armed with craft and technique. She drew inspiration not from political theory but poetry and literature.", "Still, as her post-punk contemporaries expanded their sound, Astley found her services in demand.

But her singing tones are as demure and pure as the choir soloist at an all-girls boarding school. Even her name seemed to hail from another time, evoking (via Virginia Woolf) the Bloomsbury Group, or perhaps a character in an Evelyn Waugh novel (his ", ", adapted for TV in 1981, had plunged half the nation into nostalgia for a lost aristocratic England). There\u2019s even a phonetic echo of Laura Ashley, the popular clothing designer whose floral patterns and natural fabrics harked back to the country-house world of the 19th century. Astley herself favored Fair Isle sweaters and flowing, loose-fit garments. Appearing on the cover of ", " in autumn 1983, clasping a bunch of wildflowers and with a scarf masking her face, Astley looked like a cross between a botanist and a bandit.", "Although no one else on the UK indie scene at that time made a record as beguilingly bucolic as ", ", Astley had company in other ways. She fit into a mini-phenomenon I call \u201cwide-brimmed hat music.\u201d Astley sported one herself on the cover of her 1986 album ", ". In the mid-\u201980s, the independent charts and music papers were full of hat-wearing groups like the Woodentops and Martin Stephenson and the Daintees. The headgear had nothing to with dashingly masculine hats like those worn by the Clash. These were more like the hat a pale English girl would wear to ward off freckles while being punted along the lazy rivers of Oxford or Cambridge.", "Seven years on from punk, the British rock scene\u2019s obsession with street credibility suddenly evaporated. For the first time since Kevin Ayers in the early \u201970s, a spate of UK performers no longer hid their well-spoken accents by adopting a downwardly mobile drone. Sonically, too, there was a kind of rebellion against rebellion, with artists like Everything But the Girl, Vic Godard, Weekend, and the Style Council embracing light music and middle-of-the-road sounds: Cole Porter, Astrud Gilberto, French chansonniers. In an echo of the proggy early \u201970s, another moment when rock grew comfortable with being middle-class, non-rock instruments like strings and woodwinds became chic accoutrements.

The EP\u2019s title track\u2019s chirruping vocal riff uncannily anticipates Enya\u2019s \u201cOrinoco Flow\u201d; the inspiration probably came from Laurie Anderson\u2019s voice-pulse on \u201cO Superman\u201d or the fluttery \u201csystems music\u201d of composer Michael Nyman.

Astley\u2019s account of what she\u2019s trying to do with the album is very close to Eno\u2019s definition of ambient as music that must be as ignorable as it is interesting: \u201cWhoever\u2019s listening could lie down and put it on, and not really listen to it that much,\u201d Astley suggested during the radio chat. \u201cJust have it on in the background.\u201d", "Featuring nature sounds recorded in and around the village of Moulsford-on-Thames, ", " taps into a centuries-old tradition of rhapsodic pastoralism in British culture.

Increasingly it was the ever-expanding city that came to seem like dangerous wilderness, a place whose depravity and deprivation bred both vice and radicalism. Illness and unrest alike could be inoculated, urban planners hoped, by the creation of public parks. Inspired by similar social anxieties, the garden city movement of the early 20th century created new towns that incorporated large areas of greenery, while another social initiative provided allotments of land for nominal rental fees so that ordinary townsfolk could grow their own produce and recover their inner peasant.", " recreates a single summer day from dawn to dusk: The first side of the original vinyl covers the morning, while the second is dedicated to the afternoon. \u201cI was just trying to capture that feeling you get on one of the first really hot days of summer,\u201d Astley told ", " later in 1983. \u201cThe timeless feel of the beginning of summer.\u201d \u201cWith My Eyes Wide Open I\u2019m Dreaming\u201d starts with the bright dawn chatter of birdsong, gradually interlacing piano, flute, and acoustic guitar.

Astley\u2019s wordless \u201cla-la-la\u201d vocal is mixed further back than on the EP version: It seems to reach your ear across distance, like a girl singing happily to herself while walking down the road on the other side of your garden wall. A descending piano figure gently cascades in a haze of sustain-pedal. On the title track, church bells peal in a continuous loop, suggesting that these are not chimes marking the hours of an ordinary day but an exceptional cause for communal rejoicing: a Royal Wedding, the coming of peace at the close of World War II.", "The back cover of the 2003 CD reissue of ", " features a photograph of a thatched cottage and a small, fair-haired girl who looks like Astley and which most likely stems from a brief period in her otherwise suburban childhood when she lived in the countryside. Like the hauntology of Boards of Canada and the Ghost Box label, Astley\u2019s music taps into that zone where idyllic personal memory bleeds into collective nostalgia: mythic notions of England as Arcadia.", "The atmosphere of a halcyon long-lost summer intensifies on the \u201cAfternoon\u201d side of the album. The rusty squeak of a gate between fields forms an irritable loop through \u201cOut on the Lawn I Lie in Bed,\u201d contrasting tartly with pretty xylophone chimes and piano trills in the higher octaves like rippling water rushing over rocks. \u201cToo Bright for Peacocks\u201d is an intriguing title, leaving you to wonder whether it\u2019s the birds\u2019 plumage that\u2019s so radiant in the mid-afternoon sun it makes you squint, or if it\u2019s the peacocks themselves who need shades. Staccato piano thrumming like rays pounding on your back, the track captures that heat-baked peak of the day when a wide-brimmed hat would really come in handy.", "Despite the largely acoustic palette, subtle touches of studio trickery surface every so often, most notably on \u201cWhen the Fields Were on Fire,\u201d where a high-pitched drone on loan from Nurse With Wound\u2019s ", " wavers throughout the track. Living up to the title, the piece conjures that golden hour when a certain slant of dying sunshine sets the wheatfields eerily aglow. Nominally identified as \u201cafternoon,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Too Hot to Sleep\u201d really belongs to the night, as the tu-whit tu-whoo of a tawny owl signals. The title flashes me back to the English \u201980s\u2014when air conditioning was virtually unknown in the UK\u2014but the piece itself doesn\u2019t evoke restless limbs tangled in a single sweat-soaked sheet but rather blissful drowsiness.", "In June 1983, as Astley finished work on ", ", Margaret Thatcher won reelection: a historic landslide buoyed by the jingoistic swagger that followed the nation\u2019s victory in the Falklands War, and an electoral triumph achieved despite the mass unemployment and social discord caused by her conservative economic policies.

But the summertime idyll so lovingly recreated is shadowed by the political crises of the early \u201980s, not least because the notion of England as a green and pleasant land is entangled with the nostalgic conservatism of the Thatcher era. Both the album title and \u201cOut on the Lawn I Lie in Bed\u201d come from W.H. Auden\u2019s 1933 poem \u201cA Summer Night,\u201d a mystical vision of companionship and erotic tenderness set in a country garden in the Malvern Hills. But shadows of the coming conflict in Europe pass across Auden\u2019s poem, as well as a sense of the privilege that supports such comfortable seclusion: \u201cNor ask what doubtful act allows/Our freedom in this English house/Our picnics in the sun.\u201d It\u2019s not a huge leap to connect that guilty awareness with the imperial flashback of summer 1982, when Great Britain flexed its naval might in the South Atlantic.

It\u2019s multifaceted in its messiness: a leather hide wrapped around a tender heart. That loose quality plays up the differences between father and son. Justin was a songwriter with a concise sense of melody, a singer with an eloquent approach to phrasing, and a guitar player with a style that gracefully combined traditional folk and rural blues picking. By contrast, Steve has a voice like a gravel driveway, a punk\u2019s steely bravado, and what appears to be an abiding belief that a song\u2019s imperfections are what make it so relatable. To hear Steve sing Justin\u2019s songs is to hear him erase many of those differences and emphasize their similarities: their brutal candor, their emotional rawness, but most of all their shared belief that a sturdy song was the perfect weapon to beat back their darkest demons. \u201cI don\u2019t know where I\u2019m headed, and I don\u2019t care,\u201d Steve sings on one of his son\u2019s earliest songs, \u201cI Don\u2019t Care,\u201d and it sounds like a sentiment that would alarm any father.", " ends with the set\u2019s only original from Steve, a short remembrance called \u201cLast Words.\u201d It\u2019s the only time he specifically addresses his son\u2019s death, the only time he acknowledges the very real loss that motivated this album.

It recalls one of Steve\u2019s best compositions, \u201cGoodbye,\u201d but it also brings to mind several of Justin\u2019s songs, as though the father has learned from his son.

The kids were born in Pakistan but grew up in Birmingham, England, where the family wound up after civil war erupted in their homeland in 1971.

Their process reminds me of 2003\u2019s ", ", which Madlib created by raiding the vaults of Blue Note Records, sometimes chopping the original jazz recordings intricately and sometimes letting them unfold for long stretches without much apparent editing.

Of the many mind-expanding contrasts in this passage, the most striking involves the surface quality of the audio: the way the trebly mix of an early 1980s post-punk record sounds especially brittle and tactile when it emerges out of reggae\u2019s subaqueous low end, and vice versa. Madlib\u2019s preference for leaving his samples largely raw and untreated, and his appetite for music across genres, eras, and locales, lead to many such juxtapositions. Recording fidelity is no longer a fixed characteristic of the album as a whole, but an inflection that is subject to change from moment to moment, as mutable and expressive as rhythm or pitch.", "Despite the album\u2019s frequent joyous and even comic moments, it also has the feeling of an elegy.

Soul samples arrive in herky-jerky staccato, turning half-words and breaks between syllables into unlikely hooks: pure Dilla. But the stretched-out backdrop they punctuate in the track\u2019s second half bears Madlib\u2019s smoky signature, suggesting the sound of ", " as imagined in a daydream on a lazy afternoon. It would be hard to come up with a more fitting tribute.", "One emotional peak comes during \u201cHopprock,\u201d a track whose construction seems almost offhanded: palm-muted guitar, a simple drum line, a fragment of bass that pops in every few bars.

On a series of jazz-oriented releases that feature Otis Jackson Jr. playing many or all of the live instruments himself, he has adopted a series of fanciful aliases: Yesterday\u2019s New Quintet, Sound Directions, Ahmad Miller, The Last Electro-Acoustic Space Jazz & Percussion Ensemble. Whatever other roles these characters serve in his process, they also upend received hierarchies of value in musical creativity. He\u2019s happy to take credit for an album that a traditionalist might write off as plagiarism of other people\u2019s work\u2014but when he\u2019s playing bass, drums, percussion, kalimba, synth, organ, electric piano?

When a piano enters the mix and stabs out a two-note figure that precisely mirrors the singer\u2019s exclamatory phrasing at the end of a line, the moment is mildly startling. The voice and the instrument sound like they were recorded in different decades, perhaps on different continents. As the track goes on, their involvement becomes more intimate: the piano seems to accompany the singer deliberately, harmonizing the simple melody with a jaunty left-hand bassline and densely clustered chords, as if they were in the same room. Maybe we are hearing the magic of two musicians reaching unknowingly toward each other across time and space; maybe Madlib played the piano himself along to an old field recording he likes, or maybe he hired a session musician to do it. Maybe the strange mix of fidelities is all baked into a single uncanny sample, and he\u2019s just letting it play. Whatever the answer, the effect is the same. ", " the music calls out.

Sinatra has enjoyed few major reissues. There have been many greatest-hits collections, but few that do more than scratch the surface or offer any kind of broad overarching vision. In fact, the most substantial retrospective, 2011\u2019s ", " was released on her own Boots label. That paucity of compilations makes ", " a necessary addition to her catalog and immediately the best place for a newcomer to jump into her catalog. While most compilations cover a relatively brief period in the late 1960s when she was enjoying a steady stream of hits and even filming television specials, this one extends that range well into the 1970s, concluding with her retirement in 1976. These 23 tracks cover a lot of ground musically and critically, tracing her massive hits in the mid 1960s and following her as she weathers professional upheavals and changing pop trends.\u00a0", " does not, however, include Sinatra\u2019s very first singles, when she was a teenager trying to find her voice. She calls it her \u201cNancy Nice Lady\u201d period, when she worked with Annette Funicello\u2019s producer and presented a squeaky-clean image. Even Sinatra doesn\u2019t think very highly of those songs, and ", " locates her first sessions with Hazlewood in 1965 as the true start of her career. But that older material provides an interesting point against which to measure her transformation: She dyed her hair blonde, performed on TV in go-go boots and miniskirts straight from Mary Quant\u2019s store in London. Always aware of the importance of visuals (her 1961 single \u201cCufflinks and a Tie Clip\u201d was one of the first seven-inch singles packaged in a full-color sleeve), she projected power and sophistication from the stage and from the TV screen, along with a sexual confidence and emotional maturity that made her a stand-in for an entirely new generation of American women in the mid-\u201960s. Those boots suggested a whole army behind her.\u00a0", "Those qualities extended to the music and then some. Hazlewood goaded her in a more sexual direction, often describing what he wanted in vulgar terms (in a 1968 interview with ", " Sinatra says he asked her to sing \u201clike a 13- or 14-year-old girl who goes out with 40-year-old men\u201d). But Sinatra\u2019s songs never sound vulgar. Like the first generation of rock\u2019n\u2019rollers a decade earlier, Sinatra has a blast with innuendo rather than stating her desires outright. She teases the possibilities in her infamous cover of Cher\u2019s \u201cBang Bang,\u201d as though she knows that you know what she\u2019s ", " singing about. That song was neither a single nor a hit at the time, but half a century later, it\u2019s one of Sinatra\u2019s most popular and enduring tunes largely because there are so many different layers in her performance: She foregrounds the poignancy in the lyrics\u2014the sting of betrayal, the weight of regret\u2014to match Billy Strange\u2019s noir guitar licks. Similarly, she revels in the breezy ambiguity of \u201cSugar Town,\u201d which may or may not be about turning on and tuning out. \u201cI\u2019m gonna lay right down here in the grass, and pretty soon all my troubles will pass,\u201d she sings, her voice skipping along to the melody, but the song is less about the wink and more about the calm she finds looking up at the sky.\u00a0", "As ", " progresses through her career, the songs grow more florid and more idiosyncratic, incorporating folk rock, country, chamber pop, and a kind of theatrical pastoral psychedelia. Until he abruptly moved to Sweden (allegedly without telling Sinatra) and later after he\u2019d returned to the States, Hazlewood served as her primary songwriter, and this compilation suggests that it was her versatility that allowed him to embrace his own mannerisms as a lyricist, producer, and pop conceptualist. The jump cuts on \u201cSome Velvet Morning\u201d are fairly well-known, but can still knock a listener off balance, while \u201cArkansas Coal (Suite)\u201d is more cinematic and certainly more ambitious, as Sinatra sings in the voice of a woman whose life is made and then broken by the coal mines. More generally, her voice seems to invite oddball arrangement ideas, such as the backwards guitar solo on \u201cSand\u201d or the solo kickdrum on \u201cLightning\u2019s Girl,\u201d which rumbles like an idling motorcycle. It\u2019s fun listening to her navigate these unexpected flourishes, as though she is responding to the music and the music to her.\u00a0", "One of the best moments on ", "\u2014and certainly one I\u2019ve returned to repeatedly\u2014is a small, tossed-off line on \u201cFriday\u2019s Child.\u201d The song, a hit in 1967, is about an individual abandoned by society, an outcast born with no blessings, only burdens. It seems to suggest some allegory, but Hazlewood\u2019s lyrics can be vague. Still, Sinatra invests the song with the weight of experience and empathy, culminating in the line, \u201cFriday\u2019s child\u2026 whom they\u2019ll forget to bury!\u201d She spits the line, almost choking on her disgust. It\u2019s the rare moment when Sinatra\u2019s composure threatens to crack.

Lead vocalist Laura Colwell namedrops Manhattan, Los Angeles, and New Orleans\u2014everywhere but the indie pop group\u2019s home base of Austin\u2014as memories and fantasies, but as she admits on first single \u201cEverything I Had,\u201d she\u2019s still in an apartment just three doors down from her old one.

More pressingly, once you give up on pretending, what are you left with? Sun June finds comfort in these delusions, which are couched in appropriately soft, cloudy pop. Colwell sings almost everything at the top of her range, so that every word sounds barely constricted with emotion, barely squeaked out. In the penultimate track, Colwell finally exhales, repeating a call-and-response refrain: \u201cAre you the real thing?\u201d The chords resolve and she arrives: \u201cI\u2019m the real thing. I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d", "At various points on ", ", Sun June adopt country-western tropes, maybe to play up the themes of dislocation. Like a costume put together with what they already had at home, it serves them well enough to get their point across: reverb consoles allow guitar chords to sound like they\u2019re gliding through open windows and fading out slow, and Colwell trills with Patsy Cline-ish melodrama. No matter how often you may dream about being other places or people, you\u2019re never quite where, or who, you want to be.", "These affectations represent the biggest risks taken on ", " These textures\u2013solemn, guitars, barely-there synth pads\u2013may read as pat, even self-indulgent, but for better or worse, this isn\u2019t an album interested in exploring fresh territory. Sun June are interested in daydreams as both playground and prison, and about observing what happens when you collide with the borders of your own interiority. But even in this cloudy, circumscribed world of echoing instruments, where faking and fiction are not only indulged, but necessary, Sun June\u2019s sincerity shines through. \u201cEverything I Had,\u201d for its part, might be the first successful transmutation of quarantined loneliness into an anthem: \u201cEverything I had, I want it back.\u201d Tell me about it. The song\u2019s chorus is ultimately an expression of futility and regret; the past is gone for good. Sun June yield to these fantasies, letting imagination shroud reality for a spell, but its face always shows through eventually.", "Buy: "]},

The Texas-raised songwriter is fond of large white cowboy hats. He mutters odd little jokes; he appears either slightly boozed or just a bit too shy for showbiz. But spend some time with his records and you\u2019ll understand that his distinctive observations and skewed wit are essential to his work. A decade ago, Sambol was cutting his teeth in Austin garage rock band ", ", which he\u2019d formed as a teenager.

Over 22 minutes, Sambol crafts quiet, intriguing country-folk songs that are specific and lean.", " is a small record in the best sense.

Dry, plucked guitar and minimal piano suit his wavering voice, which in his Strange Boys days was often compared to a young ", ". Though spare, ", " sounds spontaneous rather than unfinished\u2014hearing it feels like eavesdropping on a neighbor who\u2019s winding down with his six-string after work. It\u2019s one-way intimacy, the kind that comes with peeking in on someone\u2019s most vulnerable moments.", "On ", ", Sambol sifts through half-formed memories. Their shapes are subtle, but sometimes a faint impression of the past can communicate more than a detailed rendering. On \u201cJust Like Golden Hours,\u201d he recalls a modern meet-cute: \u201cWe met in the comments of one of our favorite singer\u2019s songs. We felt we had accomplished something new and young.\u201d Sambol\u2019s voice is more processed than on any other track, warbling as if transmitted through an aquatic dream, and his layered, repetitive guitar work deepens the effect. This is one of Sambol\u2019s key devices\u2014the ability to spin banal scenarios into moments of magical realism. An encounter in the comments section could indicate two loners on a YouTube binge, but Sambol makes it sound like the stuff of ", ".", "Sambol doesn\u2019t say a whole lot, but the words he utters tend to linger, inviting interpretation. On \u201cThere Are Things to Be Doing,\u201d Sambol mumbles along to his drowsy guitar: \u201cI was holding a plank/On soft carpet in the apartment of a friend/Who finds all our troubles funny.\u201d It\u2019s a simple but loaded image. You get the sense that this friend with plush flooring makes a lot more money than our protagonist\u2014a man who\u2019d rather tense up on a rug than relax across it. It can\u2019t be an accident that at least two kinds of \u201cplank\u201d are made of wood: the kind you can\u2019t comfortably sleep on, and the kind you walk off. In a single snapshot, Sambol hints at the stark yet silent contrast between struggle and a life of leisure. His opening line on \u201cBig Text\u201d is just as crammed with potential meaning: \u201cWhat a mess I want to make with you.\u201d He almost whispers it. The phrase might refer to sex, an unhealthy relationship, a ", ", or a night of eating ribs. It could mean all of those things, or none, but the fact that such a simple expression sparks so much imagery is a testament to Sambol\u2019s skill as a writer.", "Sambol\u2019s ability to compress big ideas into compact visuals might stem from his years writing poetry. On loping closer \u201cHis Aim,\u201d he marvels at broken flower pots, and how \u201cthe soil and shape remain the same\u201d after they\u2019ve shattered. On the plucky cowboy number \u201cRound the House,\u201d he directs his gratitude to a nurturing woman. \u201cI feel strong from the breakfast she made like I may never have to eat again,\u201d he drawls. \u201cHumbled, full, and safe.\u201d These are familiar things we often take for granted: the accidental beauty of a busted pot, the warmth of a home-cooked meal. But his observations forego schmaltz and defamiliarize everyday scenes.", "Some of Sambol\u2019s scenery is less familiar, even surreal. Opener \u201cYou\u2019re Still Loveable to Someone\u201d is filled with funny little sketches, like a 400-million-year-old stone that screams cryptic advice and an unusual offer of camaraderie: \u201cLet\u2019s raise money for each other sometime/If the need arose it\u2019d be good to know.\u201d It is the album\u2019s strangest yet most beautiful song, built on a sweet string melody and anchored by Sambol\u2019s forlorn sense of humor. Even at its most peculiar, there is an unexpected comfort in this music. As a narrator, Sambol isn\u2019t begging us to tag along. His voice is uneasy and hushed, like he\u2019s worried we might hear him. But if you can sneak into these songs and sit with them, their small moments of intrigue may surprise you."]},

But it is where much of her power lies. The 36-year-old songwriter and former child actress from Toronto is not the kind of singer who demands your attention but the type who doesn\u2019t seem to care whether you\u2019re listening at all: Dipping between her hushed lower register and a breezy falsetto, her delivery flows as an internal monologue. By listening closely, you are sharing her headspace, invited into a private world.

In a pivotal song called \u201c", "\u201d from 2017\u2019s ", ", Lindeman fully assumed the role of bandleader. Without sacrificing the acute, observational detail of her early work, it felt like a breakthrough. Her voice became impossible to ignore. \u201cI noticed fucking ", "\u2014the light, the reflections, different languages, your expressions,\u201d she sang with desperate anxiety, as if speeding through her usual landmarks to set a foothold somewhere new.", "On ", ", the Weather Station\u2019s dazzling fifth album, Lindeman arrives. The sound of her band\u2014which now includes two drummers, a saxophonist, and a watercolor smear of synth, strings, flute, bass, and electric guitar\u2014has never felt more versatile or distinctive, like an array of set pieces she rearranges to accompany each individual story. She sets the scene with \u201c", ",\u201d the creeping, jazzy opener whose lyrics unveil a stirring metaphor about the failures of capitalism. As the band leans in conspiratorially, responding to each subtle shift in her delivery, Lindeman shapeshifts from consoler (\u201cNo, the robber don\u2019t hate you\u201d) to confessor (\u201cWhen I was young, I learned how to make love to the robber\u201d) to a strange kind of preacher (\u201cHold open the gates for the want of lust\u201d). It is a whirlwind performance. As the music skitters and bursts in every direction, she never loses her cool.", "Co-produced with Marcus Paquin, ", " reimagines Lindeman\u2019s place within her own music and the scope of her project as a whole. Every moment feels lush and welcoming, designed to reach as many people as possible. Ironically, Lindeman wrote many of the songs alone with just an old keyboard, playing along to its rudimentary drum loops. In some songs, like \u201cSeparated,\u201d you can hear their humble beginnings: the deft, ambling rhythm of her fingerpicking is replaced with pulsing major chords; her lyrics, which once spilled into the margins with asides and scene directions, arrive in pared-down cycles of verse, swapping a few words while maintaining the general structure: \u201cSeparated by the relief you want to feel,\u201d she sings, shortly followed by, \u201cSeparated by the belief this cut would heal.\u201d", "Lindeman has hinted at these pop ambitions before\u2014her 2017 single \u201c", "\u201d felt like a first step in this direction\u2014but she has never embraced the sound so fully. After operating within the \u201970s idiom of singer-songwriter music, she now looks to the carefully constructed art-pop of the \u201980s for inspiration, finding a balance that feels both intuitive and daring. In a late-album highlight called \u201cHeart,\u201d she sings over an aerodynamic rhythm, her falsetto swooping between each substratum of percussion like a small bird navigating the floors of a mansion. It is a rare moment in her songbook where you can tune out the lyrics and just get lost in the music. In fact, Lindeman herself does precisely that in the final moments, humming a wordless refrain as her band glides along.", "This is a new trick at Lindeman\u2019s disposal\u2014these appeals to the instant pleasure centers of rhythm and melody\u2014and she can break the spell just as effectively as she casts it. \u201cI tried to wear the world like some kind of garment,\u201d she sings starkly in \u201cWear,\u201d the first moment on the album where her voice sounds truly unaccompanied, with a ticking drumbeat and high, dissonant piano chord dissolving beneath it. In songs like these, she accesses the same vulnerability that coursed through early albums like ", ". Only now, the quiet arrives more sporadically: dusky, old hiding places she leads us through on an otherwise colorful journey.", "In the time since the Weather Station\u2019s last album, Lindeman ", ", attending town halls and leading panel discussions with fellow musicians and activists in Toronto. In a ", ", she explained the similarities between these conversations and her work as a songwriter: The same way she noticed how her subtle, uncluttered music about intimate subjects could have a therapeutic effect on listeners, she sought to address what\u2019s known as \u201c", "\u201d with a sense of compassion, discussing the severity of the facts without ignoring the emotional weight.", "Throughout ", ", she suggests the first step is rejecting cynicism. It is a goal she shares with ", "\u2019s Natalie Mering, whose 2019 album ", " found beauty in similarly heavy subject matter. But where Mering\u2019s approach involved zooming out to address our problems on a cosmic scale, Lindeman takes the opposite perspective, burrowing into quiet scenes and passing feelings until they seem to hold universal significance. Plenty of us, for example, may have thoughts like the ones in \u201c", "\u201d (\u201cI should get all this dying off of my mind/I should know better than to read the headlines\u201d). But generational exhaustion is not the point. Instead, Lindeman paints an idyllic portrait, full of wonder, with a glass of wine in her hand: \u201cMy god,\u201d go the opening lines. \u201cI thought, \u2018What a sunset.\u2019\u201d", "As if leading a guided meditation, Lindeman continually turns our focus to the natural world\u2014but her findings aren\u2019t always so picturesque. She has referred to \u201cParking Lot\u201d as a \u201c", ",\u201d and, for the most part, that\u2019s what it is. Standing outside a venue before a show, and on the verge of what sounds like a minor breakdown, she notices a small bird flying around the parking lot. And so she stops to admire it. \u201cIs it alright if I don\u2019t want to sing tonight?\u201d she asks, as if sensing an omen. There\u2019s a metaphor here: the helplessness, the aimlessness, the clash between subject and setting, the quiet singing against the droning traffic. Lindeman has spent her career pondering these connections, pausing in the moments when other people are restlessly pushing forward. Her writing throughout ", " can feel like the collected epiphanies from a lifetime of observing.", "And sometimes, language fails her. In the last 90 seconds of the song, she gets hung up on the opening words of a sentence: \u201cIt kills me when I....\u201d The band anticipates a climax: A string section summons a \u201c", "\u201d sense of drama; a disco beat dances from hi-hat to snare with increasing intensity. I swear I hear a choir buried in the mix. Meanwhile, Lindeman takes another stab at the thought: \u201cYou know it just ", " me when I\u2026\u201d Eventually, she finishes the sentence.
